The user requests the AI to help design a search tool that leverages Google Search JSON API to find and screenshot the top five results based on a keyword or list of keywords. The images are then sent to a Language Model (LLM) for analysis and summarization. The AI shares a detailed plan and code in Python to implement this, involving existing utilities like `url_fetch.py` for capturing screenshots, `composer.py` for LLM interaction, and `search_utils.py` for Google API interaction.

After the user notices that the generation was cut off, the AI continues to offer the complete code for `search_tool.py` and `search_utils.py`. Finally, the user asks the AI to add support for using Ollama as a provider in `composer.py`, and the AI provides a plan and the necessary code modifications to integrate Ollama support in the `composer.py` server.
